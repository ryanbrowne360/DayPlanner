Usage:

When the user opens the planner application, they are shown what the current date is at the top of their planner.
Time blocks are clearly visible just like any other digital or paper planner. What is unique about this planner, is the user can see a colour coding based on past, present, or future. The user can enter an event, and save it in local storage. The event in which they saved will stay visible in the application even when they refresh the page.
